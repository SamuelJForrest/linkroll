## Table of Contents

## API

This project's API is based on the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)

## Setup

### First Steps

#### Environment Variables

In the project's root directory, create an `.env` file, containing the following environment variables:

-   `DEVELOPMENT`: if this environment variable exists, sets the project to 'development' mode.

### Backend

#### Install Requirements

From the root directory, run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.

### Frontend

#### Install Dependencies

`cd` into the `frontend` directory, and run the `npm install` (or `npm i`) command to install the required dependencies.

#### Run Server

While still in the `frontend` directory, run the `npm run dev` command. This command will also simultaneously run the api server (note, this will only work if the [required backend dependencies](#install-requirements) have been installed).
